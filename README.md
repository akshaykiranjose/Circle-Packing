# An Encoder-Decoder Approach for Packing Circles.

A .gif file as below was made by saving the centres returned by the encoder every 200 epochs till we obtain a satisfactory packing layout. The total number of epochs 
of training goes as high as 20,000.

towards the end of training, the circles only exhibit minor movements if and only if they don't have significant overlap with another circle.\
13 circles:

Packings of upto 19 circles could be generated using the approach.\
